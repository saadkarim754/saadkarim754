## 🛠️ About Me

I'm an enthusiastic **Electrical Engineering** student at [PIEAS](https://www.pieas.edu.pk), driven by a passion for **innovation** and a fascination with **aeronautics**. My journey into the world of avionics began with a hands-on internship at **Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) Kamra**, where I gained practical experience in **avionics production and testing**.

But that's not all! I'm also a **web enthusiast** with a solid foundation in **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**. I've put these skills to good use by developing a web application for my university’s sports society. 

I’m always eager to learn and apply my knowledge in both **aeronautics** and **web technologies**, striving to merge these interests into impactful projects.
